- Responsible for implementing automated testing processes and performance comparative analysis functions, supporting the collection and visualization of performance data for multiple versions of OpenCV, improving testing efficiency and result accuracy.
- Assisted in completing the adaptation and integration of multiple hardware devices and platforms, expanding the platform's test coverage and concurrency capabilities to meet large-scale testing needs.
- Tracked performance changes of OpenCV on the RISC-V platform, conducted data monitoring and result verification to ensure accurate capture and feedback of the impact of code modifications on performance.
- Participated in CI/CD process optimization and platform stability improvements, contributing to the iterative optimization of the platform from functional to engineering.

### 开源组织成员

_[Project Trans](https://github.com/project-trans)_ | 2024.09 - 至今

- Participated in front-end page development and CI/CD process optimization, responsible for functional module implementation, bug fixes, and code quality improvement, driving project iteration and experience optimization.
- Participated in multiple functional iterations and code refactoring, improving code maintainability and development efficiency by optimizing component reuse and improving state management.
- Managed and reviewed Pull Requests, participated in community code reviews and issue fixes, ensuring code standards and project quality.
- Actively participated in open-source collaboration and issue discussions, driving functional improvements based on community feedback, with good teamwork and communication skills.

### Host of Xiaomi Community PK Platform

_小米社区_ | 2021.08 - 2023.12

- As an initial member of the platform, participated in the construction and user growth of the PK Platform from scratch, responsible for content planning, event execution, and user operations, establishing initial user awareness and activity.
- Independently planned and organized online activities such as themed PKs and selection events, with an average interaction volume of over 2.6k per event, frequently trending on the community, significantly increasing platform exposure and user participation.
- Through data review and user feedback analysis, continuously optimized content forms and interaction mechanisms, achieving an operational closed loop from cold start to stable growth.
- Accumulatively created 470+ pieces of content, with a total interaction volume of 122w+, an average interaction volume of 2600+, and a single post's highest interaction volume reaching 28k+, creating multiple viral contents.
- Participated in user needs research, proposed product optimization suggestions, collaborated with product and operation teams to improve community functions, enhancing user experience and platform value.
