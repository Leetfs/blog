## Project Experience

### Shadow GPGPU LLVM Toolchain Development

_Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences_ | May 2025 - Present

- Participated in the open-source ecosystem construction of the Ventus GPGPU project, supporting RISC-V custom instruction set extensions.
- Added half-precision floating-point (half) support for vectors in the Ventus LLVM toolchain.
- Resolved RISC-V instruction set compatibility and code generation issues during CodeGen in the development process.

### 为 deepin RISC-V 移植 GCC 12 的 RISC-V Vector 扩展支持

_中国科学院软件研究所 开源之夏（进阶难度）_ | 2025.07 - 2025.10

- 系统性地将 GCC 13 或更高版本中稳定且关键的 RVV 扩展支持相关代码补丁，向后移植到 deepin 社区使用的 GCC 12 分支中。
- 实现 RVV Intrinsics 与自动向量化支持，确保自动向量化功能在支持 RVV 的目标上生效。

### RISC-V Automated Testing and Performance Analysis Platform Development

_Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences_ | February 2025 - May 2025

- Participated in the development and maintenance of a Jenkins-based RISC-V automated testing and performance analysis platform, focusing on performance optimization and data analysis in RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) scenarios.
- Responsible for implementing automated testing workflows, performance comparison analysis, and automatically generating HTML reports for test results.
- Automatically tracked performance changes of OpenCV on RISC-V platforms, conducted performance testing on PRs and commits, ensuring accurate capture and feedback of the impact of code modifications on performance.
