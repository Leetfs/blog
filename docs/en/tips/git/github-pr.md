## Overview

This chapter is for common issues beginners may encounter. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact the author](https://github.com/Leetfs).

## What should I do if there are new commits in the repository before my PR is merged?

If there are no merge conflicts, you can ignore it; if there are merge conflicts, you need to resolve them first.

## After my PR is merged, I want to submit a new PR

Be sure not to commit directly to the original branch, as this may cause merge conflicts.

### Solution 1

You can update the branch to the latest version

(这两个按钮都有效，第一个为更新到最新版本并舍弃你本地仓库上的提交，第二个为更新到最新版本)

### Solution 2

Create a new branch based on the upstream repository and commit in the new branch

## How to modify after submission

Before the PR is merged, the branch and PR are bound together; just modify the corresponding branch directly.

## How to review a PR

Go into the PR and click on `Files changed`
