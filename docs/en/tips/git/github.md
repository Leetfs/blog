### Getting Started with GitHub

GitHub is a large open-source community where you can freely contribute to projects you like.

GitHub Official Website: <https://github.com/>

### How do I contribute?

Register an account (details omitted here)

Go to the homepage and use the search bar to find the repository you want to contribute to, or jump directly via a repository link.

Wait for the upstream repository maintainer to merge your pull request

### Tips

On a GitHub repository page, pressing the `.` key switches to the web version of VS Code, where editing can sometimes be more convenient than the native editor.

> You can practice with [this repository](https://github.com/Leetfs/blog); start by adding missing punctuation or correcting typos~

## FAQ

These are questions commonly encountered when teaching newcomers. This section is continuously updated.

### What if I can't find my forked repository?

Click your avatar in the upper right corner, then select `Your repositories` from the sidebar that appears.

**Note:**

> Clicking the `Forked from ...` below the repository name will jump to the upstream repository, but usually you can only push changes to upstream via PR (pull request) unless you have direct push access to the upstream repository.
