## Projects Involved

### Ventus GPGPU LLVM Toolchain Development

_Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences_ | 2025.05 - Present

- Participated in the open-source ecosystem construction of the Ventus GPGPU project, supporting the implementation of RISC-V custom instruction sets.
- Deeply involved in the development and optimization of the Ventus GPGPU LLVM toolchain, solving adaptation issues for the RISC-V instruction set, and completing functional verification and debugging of the compiler.
- Solved compatibility and correctness issues for the RISC-V instruction set in the CodeGen phase, completing the compiler's **functional verification, debugging, and performance testing**.

### RISC-V Automated Testing and Performance Analysis Platform Development

_Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences_ | 2025.02 - 2025.05

- Participated in the development and maintenance of a **Jenkins-based RISC-V automated testing and performance analysis platform**, focusing on performance optimization and data analysis in the context of RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV).
- Responsible for implementing **automated testing processes and performance comparison analysis functions**, supporting the collection and visualization of performance data for multiple versions of OpenCV, improving testing efficiency and result accuracy.
- Assisted in completing **the adaptation and integration of multiple hardware devices and platforms**, expanding the platform's test coverage and concurrency capabilities to meet large-scale testing demands.
- Tracked performance changes of OpenCV on the RISC-V platform, conducted data monitoring and result verification to ensure that the impact of code modifications on performance was accurately captured and feedback was provided.
- Participated in **CI/CD process optimization and platform stability improvements**, contributing to the iterative optimization of the platform from functional to engineering.
